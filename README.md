# Interaction Design-Project Assignment

The purpose of this project assignment is to design and prototype interactive tangible objects. You will use [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) an open source toolkit.

## Initial Settings
- You must first create a [Github](https://github.com/) account, using the university email, and then fork the [repository](https://github.com/merkourisa/Interaction-Design-Project-Assignment).
- You must create a team of 2-3 fellow students (collaborators). See in the discussion session the procedure for creating the teams.

## Thematic Areas
- [E-textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-textiles) 
- Human Well Being - Emotion & Communication. Motive and Assist Users to Convey and Communicate Emotions with Tangible Objects
- [Tangible Kidsâ€™ toys](http://nowclassrooms.com/top-ten-tangible-tech-toys-for-2018/)
- [Interactive Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_art)
 
**Attention:** Examples & Ideas will be discussed during class!!!

## Steps to consider for the final submission (+ importance):
1.	Design Brief (Short description of the project: main goals) (1/2 page max)
2.	Research (Based on PACT) (2 pages max):
    1.	Analyse People (users and other stakeholders, define target group - Which are your users)
    2.	Define Activities (What users do before your project!)
    3.	Describe Context (What are the contextual information we have before the intervention)
    4.	Review needed Technologies (locate and analyse similar projects, collect technologies that you plan to use:     platform/Arduino etc, sensors, actuators, software etc)
3.	Information architecture (outline the major information components/content and their organisation) (2 pages max)
4.	User Interaction (Plan and analyse new interaction behaviour based on the activities described on step 2.2) (1 page max)
5.	Interface design (Outline interface components - Define each component's role, behaviour, relation to other) (1 page max)
6.	Scenarios & Storyboarding (Prepare short scenarios focused on specific activities, create storyboards that present activities in action)(1 pages max)
7.	Prototyping (Create a prototype based on a single scenario)(2 pages max)

## Deadlines
- **Deliverable 1**  (Steps 1-2):   until 25/03/2022 
- **Deliverable 2**  (Steps 3-5):   until 29/04/2022
- **Deliverable 3**  (Steps 6-7):   until 03/06/2022

## Grading 
The group assignment will contribute up to 5 points in the grade. Each member of the team will get the same grade.

## Report
You submit in your Github repository:
- Single [report](our_report/README.md) (15 pages max): Describes the design research and processes of steps 1-7 (++++)
- Link to video with prototype presentation. (++++)
- Any files you consider important (e.g. arduino code, databases, design schema etc) (+++)

## Questions

For any questions, regarding the deliverables, in the Discussions session, not only you can ask but you can also answer.
